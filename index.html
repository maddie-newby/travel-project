          <h3>Why Manchester?</h3>
          <h2>Manchester, a confident and creative city.</h2>
          <p>
            A revolutionary and progressive spirit infuses the history of both city and University. For the city, it led
            to
            new
            political thinking; the Chartist, trade union and suffragette movements can all trace their roots back to
            Manchester.
            For the University, it led to ground-breaking innovation in science and engineering that continues to this
            day,
            as
            Manchester gave the world atomic power, the first stored-program computers and the world’s strongest
            material,
            graphene.
          </p>
          <p>
            The city has an international sporting pedigree and one of the richest and most influential arts and music
            scenes. There
            are world-class events, venues and attractions to suit every lifestyle, with a lively, culturally diverse
            city
            centre
            that’s easy to enjoy on a student budget.</p>
